			<h2>Subtheme: Corporate Ownership & Housing Instability</h2>
            <h3>Introduction</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>This report examines the relationship between corporate ownership of residential properties, owner-occupancy trends, racial demographics, and potential eviction risks in Boston neighborhoods from 2004 to 2024. Prior research suggests that corporate landlords file for more evictions than live-in landlords, disproportionately affecting communities of color. This study analyzes data from Boston property assessments and census records to evaluate these claims.</li>
			</ol>
            <h3>Data Overview</h3>
            <h4>The datasets used in this study include:</h4>
            
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Boston Neighborhoods and Zip Codes:</strong> Provides mapping between neighborhoods and zip codes.</li>
              <li><strong>Census and Corporate Ownership Data:</strong> Contains demographic breakdowns, owner-occupancy rates, corporate ownership rates, and institutionalized population data.</li>
              <li><strong>Corporate Ownership Over Time:</strong> Tracks corporate ownership rates and owner-occupancy rates across neighborhoods over 20 years.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Key Variables Analyzed</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Corporate ownership rate (% of properties owned by corporations)</li>
              <li>Owner-occupancy rate (% of properties occupied by owners)</li>
              <li>Demographics: Racial breakdowns (Black, Hispanic, White, Asian populations)</li>
              <li>Housing characteristics: Vacancy rates, total housing units</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Even though the datasets don't explicitly provide the number of rental units, we can infer it. The rental units percentage will be equal to 1 - (owner occupancy percentage), while the number of rental units will equal the total number of units multiplied by the rental units percentage.</p>
            
            <p>Neither of the provided data sets in .csv have any information on the rates of evictions. However, we were able to extract relevant data from the readings (report) and sources used by the authors of the report.</p>
			<h3>Overall Analysis Questions</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>How does corporate ownership correlate with housing instability?</li>
				<li>What demographic trends emerge from the eviction data?</li>
				<li>How can property, census, and court data be integrated to reveal spatial patterns?</li>
			</ol>

			<h2>Summary</h2>
			<p>
				This project integrates Boston property and census data with court eviction filings to explore how corporate ownership correlates with housing instability across neighborhoods. Through detailed data integration and interactive visualizations, the analysis reveals nuanced patterns and trends driven by institutional landlord practices.
