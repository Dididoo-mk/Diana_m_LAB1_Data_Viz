			<h2>Subtheme: Corporate Ownership & Housing Instability</h2>
			
			<p>
			  Prior research (such as the Homes For All report below) has shown that corporate and absentee landlords evicted more people during COVID in the state of MA. Evictions can have devastating impacts on residents, families and communities. Conversely, live-in (or live-nearby) landlords tended to file for fewer evictions, leading the report to make a recommendation that local control of property contributes to housing stability. Communities of color, especially Black and Latinx people, faced particularly high rates of eviction. Do these findings hold up in the City of Boston? Are there more evictions in census tracts with less owners living in them? How have rates of owner occupancy and corporate ownership in Boston changed over time? Are there more corporate landlords now than there have been in the past?
			</p>
		  
			<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
			<p>
			  In this report I examined the relationship between corporate ownership of residential properties, owner-occupancy trends, racial demographics, and potential eviction risks in Boston neighborhoods from 2004 to 2024. Prior research (such as the Homes for All MA report and NYT article) suggests that corporate landlords are more likely to file eviction proceedings than live-in landlords, disproportionately affecting communities of color. This study analyzes data from Boston property assessments and census records to evaluate these claims and to explore how changes in ownership structures might influence eviction filing rates.
			</p>
			<p><strong>Key questions include:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			  <li>Are neighborhoods with more corporate-owned (or absentee) properties experiencing higher rates of eviction?</li>
			  <li>Have corporate ownership and owner-occupancy rates changed significantly over the past 20 years?</li>
			  <li>Are there notable racial disparities in where evictions are concentrated?</li>
			  <li>How do corporate ownership and owner-occupancy rates compare across Boston neighborhoods?</li>
			  <li>What is the relationship between owner-occupancy rates and eviction filing rates in Boston neighborhoods?</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
			  In this report, I used aggregated neighborhood-level and census data on property ownership and demographics, as well as eviction filing data drawn from Massachusetts court filings, to examine and answer those questions.
			</p>
		  
			<h2>2. Data Overview</h2>
			<p>The datasets used in this study include:</p>
			<ul>
			  <li><strong>Boston Neighborhoods and Zip Codes:</strong> Provides mapping between neighborhoods and zip codes.</li>
			  <li><strong>Census and Corporate Ownership Data:</strong> Contains demographic breakdowns, owner-occupancy rates, corporate ownership rates, and institutionalized population data.</li>
			  <li><strong>Corporate Ownership Over Time:</strong> Tracks corporate ownership rates and owner-occupancy rates across neighborhoods over 20 years.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Key variables analyzed:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			  <li>Corporate ownership rate (% of properties owned by corporations)</li>
			  <li>Owner-occupancy rate (% of properties occupied by owners)</li>
			  <li>Demographics: Racial breakdowns (Black, Hispanic, White, Asian populations)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
			  Although the datasets do not directly provide total numbers of rental units, one can approximate by using 1 – (owner occupancy rate) as the rental percentage. Neither of the provided data sets in .csv had any information on the number of evictions or rates of evictions across neighborhoods. Therefore, the eviction-filing numbers were obtained from external reporting (including Mass Landlords association, Massachusetts court filings, city records, and analyses by advocacy organizations).
			</p>
		  
			<h2>3. Key Findings</h2>
			<h3>Corporate Ownership Is Rising Citywide</h3>
			<ul>
			  <li>
				From 2004 to 2024, corporate ownership of housing stock steadily increased in nearly every Boston neighborhood. Certain areas such as Roxbury, Downtown, and the South Boston Waterfront experienced sharper post-2015 accelerations, indicating significant investor activity.
			  </li>
			</ul>
		  
			<h3>Owner-Occupancy Rates Remain Higher in Peripheral Neighborhoods</h3>
			<ul>
			  <li>
				Neighborhoods like West Roxbury, Roslindale, and Hyde Park continue to have a high share of owner-occupied homes, showing only moderate drops in owner-occupancy over the 20-year period. Central neighborhoods—especially those with substantial student populations (e.g., Allston, Mission Hill)—maintained low owner-occupancy rates, indicating that rental markets remain dominant there.
			  </li>
			</ul>
		  
			<h3>Evictions Are More Prevalent Where Owners Do Not Reside</h3>
			<ul>
			  <li>
				Across Boston’s neighborhoods, low owner-occupancy correlates strongly with higher eviction filing rates. Neighborhoods such as East Boston, Mattapan, and parts of Dorchester, which have lower proportions of live-in owners, also show some of the highest eviction filing rates.
			  </li>
			</ul>
		  
			<h3>Communities of Color Experience Disproportionately Higher Eviction Rates</h3>
			<ul>
			  <li>
				Aligning with prior research, census tracts that have higher percentages of Black and Latinx residents tend to face higher eviction filing rates. This pattern suggests that residents of color may be especially vulnerable to displacement pressures in neighborhoods dominated by corporate or absentee ownership.
			  </li>
			</ul>
		  
			<h3>Investor Purchases in Traditionally Renter-Heavy Areas</h3>
			<ul>
			  <li>
				Renter-heavy neighborhoods (e.g., East Boston, parts of Roxbury) have seen notable spikes in corporate ownership. Coupled with existing lower owner-occupancy, these changes can lead to increased churn in rental housing and a heightened risk of eviction for tenants.
			  </li>
			</ul>
		  
			<h2>4. Discoveries &amp; Insights</h2>
			<p>
			  Below are the key research questions I formulated that guided my research and analysis of the topic. 
			  Each question is followed by summaries of the relevant visual analyses.
			</p>
		  
			<div class="section">
			  <h2>Research Question 1: How have corporate property ownership rates and owner-occupancy rates changed in Boston’s neighborhoods from 2004 to 2024?</h2>
			  <p>
				Over a span of 20 years, I analyzed property data to understand who owns Boston’s housing and who lives in it. 
				The findings point to notable changes in both corporate ownership (properties held by LLCs, trusts, or companies) 
				and owner-occupancy (homes occupied by their owners). The charts below illustrate these trends across various neighborhoods.
			  </p>
			</div>
		  
			<div class="section">
			  <h2>Visualization 1-a: Citywide Overview</h2>
			  <p>
				The first chart compares corporate ownership rates (upper panel) with owner-occupancy rates (lower panel) 
				for all Boston neighborhoods between 2004 and 2024.

				<figcaption>Line Chart of Ownership Trends (2004–2024) for All Neighborhoods</figcaption>
			  </figure>
			  <h3>Key Observations (Citywide)</h3>
			  <ul>
				<li>Corporate ownership has steadily increased across the city, with a noticeable acceleration after 2015.</li>
				<li>Owner-occupancy rates remained stable in some areas but declined in others.</li>
				<li>Central neighborhoods experienced the most significant shift toward investor-owned properties.</li>
			  </ul>
			  <p>
				<strong>Insight:</strong> Overall, there is a clear trend toward more investor-owned properties and fewer resident homeowners in Boston, 
				although the speed and extent of these changes vary by neighborhood.
			  </p>
			</div>
		  
			<div class="section">
			  <h2>Visualization 1-b: Neighborhood-Specific Analysis</h2>
			  <p>
				The second image provides a neighborhood-by-neighborhood breakdown, while the third chart uses a 
				<strong>dual line chart</strong> to highlight how corporate ownership and owner-occupancy rates 
				have evolved side by side in selected areas.

			  <p>
				<strong>Why a dual line chart?</strong> A dual line chart enables a direct, simultaneous comparison of two related metrics—
				here, corporate ownership and owner-occupancy—within the same visual space. This approach makes it easier to observe 
				how changes in one measure may coincide with or influence changes in the other over time.
			  </p>
			  <h3>Key Observations (Selected Neighborhoods)</h3>
			  <ul>
				<li>Roxbury, Downtown, and the South Boston Waterfront have seen sharp increases in corporate ownership.</li>
				<li>Traditional residential areas like West Roxbury and Roslindale continue to maintain higher owner-occupancy rates.</li>
				<li>Student-heavy neighborhoods (e.g., Allston, Mission Hill) remain dominated by rental properties.</li>
				<li>Some neighborhoods experienced notable spikes in corporate ownership after 2020.</li>

			  <p>
				These two maps compare corporate ownership and owner-occupancy levels across Boston’s neighborhoods in 2004 and 2024. Color-coding highlights how outer neighborhoods (e.g., West Roxbury) have historically maintained higher owner-occupancy rates, while central areas (e.g., Mission Hill) show lower levels. Over time, investor ownership has expanded in renter-heavy neighborhoods, potentially increasing housing instability.

			<h2>Research Question 2: Do neighborhoods with lower owner-occupancy experience higher eviction filing rates?</h2>
		  
			<div class="section">
			  <h2>Overview</h2>
			  <p>
				This analysis explores whether neighborhoods with fewer resident owners (i.e., more absentee landlords) see higher rates of eviction filings. By comparing court records and property data, a clear pattern emerges that links lower owner-occupancy to increased tenant displacement.

			<h2>Research Question 4: Are there racial disparities in eviction filing rates across Boston’s neighborhoods, and how do eviction patterns relate to neighborhood demographics?</h2>
		  
			<div class="section">
			  <p>
				Building on prior findings showing racial disparities in eviction filings across the state, this analysis focuses on the racial composition of Boston neighborhoods and their corresponding eviction rates. Census demographic data was combined with 2021–2024 eviction filings sourced from MassLandlords, Inc (<a href="https://masslandlords.net/policy/eviction-data/">online data</a>), following the approach in the Homes For All report. By mapping the percentage of residents of color, we can compare these areas to eviction patterns and investigate how neighborhood demographics influence housing stability.

				This scatterplot is similar to Visualization 4-b but focuses specifically on the percentage of Hispanic residents rather than the overall population of color. Each point represents a Boston neighborhood, with the x-axis showing the percentage of Hispanic residents and the y-axis representing eviction filings per 1,000 renters (averaged from 2021–2024).

			  <h3>Key Observations</h3>
			  <ul>
				<li><strong>Positive Correlation:</strong> There remains a link between higher eviction rates and a larger share of Hispanic residents, though not as pronounced as when considering the entire population of color.</li>
				<li><strong>Clarity vs. Other Measures:</strong> This correlation appears clearer than in the Black population scatterplot (4-c) but less strong than in the overall population of color scatterplot (4-b).</li>
				<li><strong>Confounding Factors:</strong> Other variables—such as income levels, housing stock, or investor ownership—may also shape eviction patterns in these neighborhoods.</li>

			<h2>Summary</h2>
			<p>Over the past two decades, Boston’s housing landscape has experienced a significant shift toward corporate and absentee ownership, particularly in neighborhoods with already low owner-occupancy rates and high concentrations of communities of color. This study explored the relationship between corporate ownership, eviction filings, and racial disparities in housing stability across Boston from 2004 to 2024. By analyzing property ownership data, census records, and court eviction filings, the research found strong correlations between investor-driven ownership and increased eviction risks.</p>
			<p>Corporate landlords, particularly those in high-renter neighborhoods like East Boston, Mattapan, and Roxbury, have contributed to increased eviction filings, disproportionately affecting Black and Latinx residents. Conversely, neighborhoods with a higher share of owner-occupied properties, such as West Roxbury and Roslindale, have maintained greater housing stability, with fewer evictions. The findings reinforce previous research suggesting that live-in landlords tend to file fewer eviction proceedings, while corporate landlords—who operate at a distance—are more likely to pursue tenant displacement.</p>
			<p>The study also highlights a clear racial disparity in eviction patterns. Predominantly nonwhite neighborhoods experience significantly higher eviction rates than majority-white neighborhoods, revealing systemic inequities in housing security. The results point to the pressing need for stronger tenant protections, policies that encourage local homeownership, and equity-driven interventions to mitigate displacement risks in vulnerable communities.</p>
			<h2>Conclusion</h2>
			<p>The findings of this study underscore the critical impact of corporate ownership on housing stability in Boston. Over the last two decades, investor-driven acquisitions have expanded significantly, particularly in renter-heavy areas, leading to increased eviction filings and housing insecurity. The data suggests that absentee ownership is a key driver of eviction risks, reinforcing the need for policies that prioritize resident ownership and long-term tenancy protections.</p>
			<p>Neighborhoods with lower owner-occupancy rates consistently experience higher eviction filings, highlighting the stabilizing role of live-in landlords. Moreover, the racial disparities in eviction filings indicate that communities of color, especially Black and Latinx residents, are disproportionately affected by displacement pressures. The rise in corporate ownership has reshaped the rental market, driving turnover and reducing housing security in vulnerable areas.</p>
			<p>Addressing these challenges requires strengthened tenant protections, policies that encourage local homeownership, and regulatory measures to limit the negative effects of investor-driven displacement. Without intervention, these trends may continue to exacerbate inequality and instability, making it imperative to implement equity-focused housing policies that promote long-term affordability and community resilience.</p>
