      <h2>Original Visualization from the Assignment</h2>
      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>
        For this assignment, we were asked to analyze and critique a well-known data visualization, looking at what works, what doesn’t, and how it could be improved. The visualization we examined comes from The New York Times, where it was used to illustrate the rise and fall of COVID-19 cases during the Omicron variant peak. The article was written by Dr. Jeffrey Shaman, an epidemiologist and infectious disease modeler at Columbia University, whose team helped develop some of the earliest COVID-19 models.
      </p>
      <p>Here is the original visualization:</p>

        <figcaption>New Covid-19 Cases United States</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <h3>Insights from the Visualization</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The spiral chart depicts new COVID-19 cases in the U.S. from 2020 to early 2022, with each loop representing a year.</li>
        <li>Thicker red bands indicate higher case counts, showing major surges in winter months, especially January 2021 and January 2022, with 2022 reaching the highest peak (Omicron variant).</li>
        <li>The pattern highlights recurring waves of infection, with each winter surge surpassing the previous year.</li>
        <li>While the spiral format conveys the cyclical nature of the pandemic, it makes precise comparisons between years difficult due to distortion.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Critique</h3>
      <p>
        The spiral visualization does a creative job of encoding time and COVID-19 case trends, but its effectiveness in communicating key insights is questionable. The spiral shape highlights the cyclical nature of the pandemic, drawing connections between peaks across years, but the complexity it adds makes it harder to interpret precisely. The varying thickness of the spiral bands does a good job showing case surges, but the radial scale is unconventional and might confuse viewers at first glance. Without clear tick marks or numerical labels for case counts, the audience is left to estimate values rather than read them directly. Additionally, the focus on winter peaks, while important, makes it difficult to capture the smaller fluctuations within each year—a more linear format would serve that purpose better. The spiral visualization effectively captures the pandemic's cyclical nature, emphasizing recurring peaks during winter months. However, its unconventional design may prioritize aesthetics over functional clarity, making precise data interpretation challenging for some viewers.
      </p>
      <p>
        While the target audience—general readers interested in pandemic trends—might grasp the broad message of waves rising and falling, the visualization requires a lot of effort to interpret. The takeaway about seasonal surges and pandemic persistence is there, but it could be more clearly emphasized with annotations or comparative markers. Labeling is sparse, leaving viewers to figure out the meaning of shaded regions and the spiral’s growth. The spacing and layout are visually appealing, but they prioritize aesthetics over clarity, as the overlapping arms of the spiral obscure year-to-year comparisons. A more traditional time-series chart, small multiples, or stacked area chart would boost readability while still delivering the core message.
      </p>
      <p>
        These insights set the stage for exploring alternative visualizations.

    <h2>Exploring Alternative Visualizations: Addressing the Spiral’s Limitations</h2>
    
    <h3>Sketch 1: COVID-19 Case Trends In The U.S. (2020-2022) – Stacked Area Chart</h3>
    <figure style="width:100%; margin:2em auto; overflow:hidden;">
      <img src="../images/A3_10_1.jpg" alt="Stacked Area Chart Sketch" style="display:block; width:100%; height:auto; object-fit:contain; margin:0 auto;">
      <figcaption>COVID-19 Case Trends In The U.S. (2020-2022) – Stacked Area Chart</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <h3>Rationale for Design Decisions</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>The stacked area chart replaces the spiral format to allow for a clearer year-over-year comparison of COVID-19 case trends.</li>
      <li>Time is plotted on a standard X-axis, making it easier to follow trends month by month.</li>
      <li>The Y-axis represents the total number of new monthly cases, making it easy to see the relative severity of each pandemic wave.</li>
      <li>Each year is color-coded to differentiate trends while maintaining visual clarity.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>What Worked Well?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Trends are easier to interpret compared to the original spiral, making it clear when and how case surges occurred.</li>
      <li>Seasonal peaks (especially in winter) stand out clearly, with the largest spikes in January 2021 and January 2022.</li>
      <li>Layering the years allows for a direct comparison, showing that each winter surge surpassed the previous year’s peak.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Challenges &amp; Limitations</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>If case numbers are too high, the layering might make it harder to distinguish trends for individual years.</li>
      <li>Seasonal patterns may not stand out as prominently as in the spiral format since all years are stacked together.</li>
      <li>Smaller fluctuations within each year are not as visible as they would be in a line chart.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Next Steps: What to Explore in the Next Sketch?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>I am considering a “Small Multiples” approach where each year is plotted separately but aligned, making year-over-year trends clearer.</li>
      <li>Experimenting with a Multi-Line Chart to better highlight seasonal trends without overlapping layers.</li>
      <li>Adding annotations for major peaks (Omicron, Delta, Winter 2020) could improve readability and data storytelling.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Sketch 2: Multi-Line Chart (Small Multiples) – Design Rationale &amp; Reflection</h3>
    <figure style="width:100%; margin:2em auto; overflow:hidden;">
      <img src="../images/A3_10_2.jpg" alt="Multi-Line Chart Sketch" style="display:block; width:100%; height:auto; object-fit:contain; margin:0 auto;">
      <figcaption>COVID-19 Case Trends In The U.S. (2020-2022) – Multi-Line Chart</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <h3>Rationale for Design Decisions</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Instead of stacking all data in a single chart, this approach separates each year into its own subplot, making trends easier to follow.</li>
      <li>The same X-axis (months) is used across all three charts to allow for direct year-over-year comparisons without distortion.</li>
      <li>A simple line chart format is used to ensure clarity and precision, avoiding the potential clutter of stacked area charts.</li>
      <li>Color-coding each year helps differentiate the data while maintaining visual consistency.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>What Worked Well?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Preserves each year’s trends without overlap, making seasonality and pandemic waves stand out clearly.</li>
      <li>Reduces visual clutter compared to stacked area or spiral charts.</li>
      <li>Makes year-to-year comparisons more intuitive, as users can directly look at corresponding months in different years.</li>
      <li>Maintains a strong focus on seasonal peaks, particularly January 2021 and January 2022 surges.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Challenges &amp; Limitations</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Takes up more space than a single combined chart, which might make it harder to present in compact formats.</li>
      <li>Comparing exact values across years requires scanning between subplots, rather than seeing trends in one unified graph.</li>
      <li>Less emphasis on cumulative growth, since years are separated rather than stacked.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Next Steps: What to Explore in the Next Sketch?</h3>
    <p>
      I am considereing overlaying the lines into a single chart instead of splitting them into separate subplots. This way, it’ll be easier to compare year-over-year trends without having to scan between different sections.
    </p>
    <p>
      To avoid making it messy, I might use transparency or dashed lines so overlapping trends don’t become confusing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another idea I have is adding annotations or markers for key events—like the Omicron and Delta surges—to improve clarity and storytelling.
    </p>

    <h3>Sketch 3: Radial Bar Chart</h3>
    <figure style="width:100%; margin:2em auto; overflow:hidden;">
      <img src="../images/A3_10_3.jpg" alt="Radial Bar Chart" style="display:block; width:100%; height:auto; object-fit:contain; margin:0 auto;">
      <figcaption>COVID-19 Case Trends In The U.S. (2020-2022) – Radial Bar Chart</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <h3>Why I Chose This Design</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>I wanted to keep the cyclical feel of the original spiral while making it clearer and easier to compare across years – a radial bar chart works well for this because it separates each year’s data into its own ring.</li>
      <li>Color choices help distinguish the years while keeping a logical progression.</li>
      <li>Offsets between the rings ensure that 2020 isn’t hidden, which was a problem in earlier versions.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>What Worked Well?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Keeps the cyclical nature of the data while making trends across years much easier to compare.</li>
      <li>Seasonality is clear – The January peaks in 2021 and 2022 stand out well.</li>
      <li>Better readability than the spiral chart – No confusing overlaps, and everything is spaced out clearly.</li>
      <li>Edge outlines help – They make each bar more distinct, improving contrast.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>What Didn’t Work So Well?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Exact case numbers aren’t immediately visible since the chart is based on bar height rather than a labeled Y-axis.</li>
      <li>Radial layouts can exaggerate differences, as bars further from the center might look disproportionately large.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Next Steps: Where to Go From Here?</h3>
    <p>
      I’m considering a radial heatmap using a color gradient to show case intensity, which might better capture the continuous flow of the data. A semi-circular layout might also enhance readability since timelines are typically read left to right.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another idea is to overlay a line chart within the radial structure to depict the overall trend alongside the bars.
    </p>

    <h2>Redesigned Visualization: Designing a Compelling Data Story</h2>
    <figure style="width:100%; margin:2em auto; overflow:hidden;">
      <img src="../images/maybe_covid_waves_visualization.jpg" alt="Radial Bar Chart" style="display:block; width:100%; height:auto; object-fit:contain; margin:0 auto;">
      <figcaption>US COVID-19 Pandemic: The Four Major Waves (2020-2022)</figcaption>
    </figure>
    

    <p>My main goal with this redesign was to create a clear and intuitive visualization of the four major COVID-19 waves in the U.S. from 2020 to 2022. I decided to move away from the original spiral format and use a more conventional time-series area chart that makes comparisons across time easier and more interpretable. While the original design highlighted the cyclical nature of the pandemic, I found that it introduced distortions that made it difficult to compare the scale of waves accurately. My focus was on improving readability so that viewers could immediately grasp the timing and magnitude of each surge. I also applied a <span class="highlight">7-day moving average</span> to smooth out reporting inconsistencies while maintaining the key trends, ensuring that the visualization effectively communicates broader pandemic patterns rather than short-term fluctuations.</p>
    

    
    <p>To make the phases of the pandemic distinct, I used <span class="highlight">color coding</span>—purple for the First Wave, green for the Delta Wave, yellow for Omicron, and orange for Later Waves. This choice helps differentiate the different waves while also maintaining their connection to the overall progression of the pandemic. For the horizontal axis, I chose to represent time in quarters (<span class="highlight">Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4</span>), which are standard fiscal and calendar divisions of the year:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Q1:</strong> January to March</li>
        <li><strong>Q2:</strong> April to June</li>
        <li><strong>Q3:</strong> July to September</li>
        <li><strong>Q4:</strong> October to December</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>I found that using this quarter-based format made it easier to compare trends across years in a structured way. The vertical axis represents <span class="highlight">daily new cases</span> (averaged over 7 days), which provides a clearer measure of the pandemic’s severity at different points in time.</p>
    
  
    
    <p>To add more context, I included <span class="highlight">vertical reference lines</span> marking important milestones, such as the declaration of a national emergency, the first vaccine rollout, and the identification of major variants. By incorporating these annotations, I wanted to make it easier to connect public health events with shifts in case trends. I chose an <span class="highlight">area chart</span> instead of a line graph because I wanted to emphasize the scale of each wave—particularly the dramatic spike during the Omicron wave—without cluttering the visualization with too many overlapping lines.</p>
    
    <h2>Trade-offs & Future Considerations</h2>
    
    <p>Although I believe this redesign significantly improves readability, I had to make some trade-offs. Focusing on broader pandemic trends meant that some finer details—such as short-lived fluctuations and daily volatility—became less prominent. Additionally, while I personally find the quarter-based timeline effective, some viewers who are unfamiliar with Q1-Q4 notation might need a moment to interpret the divisions. However, I think the overall visualization successfully tells the story of the pandemic’s progression while balancing clarity, accuracy, and context.</p>
    
    <p>Going through this <span class="highlight">critique by redesign</span> process, I realized just how challenging it is to capture both macro and micro trends in a single visualization. While this design resolves many of the interpretability issues in the original, I see potential for future improvements. I’d love to explore <span class="highlight">interactive features</span> that allow users to zoom into specific time periods or highlight particular data points while maintaining the broad overview. This project reinforced the importance of balancing aesthetics with clarity, and I’m excited to continue refining this approach in future work.</p>

    <p>I am going to attach my code at the bottom of this page - so anyone who wants to improve or build up on it is welcome!</p>
