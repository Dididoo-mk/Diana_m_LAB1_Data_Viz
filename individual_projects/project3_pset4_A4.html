      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        This assignment explores the persuasive and potentially deceptive power of data visualization. The goal was to create two contrasting visualizations — one supporting and one challenging a given proposition — using different visual techniques. After analyzing abortion data from the Guttmacher Institute, I chose the following proposition:
      </p>
      <p> <strong>Proposition:</strong> "The closure of abortion clinics significantly reduces abortion rates." </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Supporting Visualization: The Vanishing Clinics Effect</h2>
      <p> This visualization compares the percentage change in the number of abortion clinics with the percentage change in abortion rates from 2017 to 2020. By placing these two metrics side by side, a pattern emerges: states with notable clinic closures also saw declines in abortion rates. Missouri, in particular, shows a dramatic reduction in both.</p>

      <h2>Opposing Visualization: Resilient Trends in Abortion Access</h2>
      <p> This visualization highlights states where abortion rates increased or remained stable despite clinic closures, suggesting that access patterns may be more complex than they appear. </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="../images/A4_image_(5).png" alt="Resilient Trends in Abortion Access">
        <figcaption>Closure of Abortion Clinics does not reduce Abortion Rates</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Final Reflection</h2>
      <p>
        By keeping both visualizations similar in design, I aimed to emphasize how manipulative techniques — like selective data inclusion, altered axis scales, and provocative titles — can dramatically change the narrative. The same dataset can be presented to either reinforce or contradict a given claim. The biggest manipulation in both charts lies in the selective choice of data, which was curated to push the intended argument.
      </p>
      <p>
        While one visualization highlights states with a strong correlation between clinic closures and declining abortion rates, the other highlights states with no clear pattern. These opposing narratives demonstrate how data visualizations can shape public perception. Ethical data visualization requires not just accuracy but transparency in the methods used to present data.
