      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        In this assignment, we were tasked with exploring the persuasive and potentially deceptive power of data visualization. Our goal was to create two contrasting visualizations — one that convincingly supports a chosen proposition and one that challenges it — using design techniques that range from earnest to subtly manipulative. After analyzing abortion data from the Guttmacher Institute, I chose the following proposition:
      </p>
      <p> <strong>Proposition:</strong>  "The closure of abortion clinics significantly reduces abortion rates." </p>
    </section>
    ,<section>
      <h2>"The closure of abortion clinics significantly reduces abortion rates"</h2>
      <p>I chose this proposition because it presents a highly charged and politically relevant topic that has been the focus of public debate and policy-making in the United States. With reproductive rights and access to healthcare being deeply contested issues, exploring this dataset allowed me to investigate the role of data visualization in shaping public perception. The correlation between clinic closures and abortion rates is often cited in media and political discourse, yet this relationship is far more complex than it initially appears.</p>
    
      <p> By selecting this proposition, I aimed to explore how visual framing could amplify or obscure this complexity. Through careful design decisions, I sought to examine whether visualizing certain data patterns could mislead viewers into believing a direct causal link — even when the reality may be driven by broader social, economic, and policy factors. This choice not only provided an opportunity to analyze nuanced data but also underscored the ethical implications of visualization in politically sensitive contexts. </p>

      <h2>Supporting Visualization: The Vanishing Clinics Effect</h2>
      <figure>
        <img src="../images/A4_image_(4).png" alt="1">
        <figcaption>Timeline of Policy Changes and Clinic Closures Impact on Abortion Rates</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        This visualization aims to persuade the viewer that the closure of abortion clinics has a clear and significant impact on reducing abortion rates. Using a timeline-based flow chart, key policy changes and clinic closures are mapped against abortion rate trends, creating a compelling narrative that highlights cause and effect.
      </p>


      <h3>Design Rationale</h3>
      <ul>
        <li> <strong>Emotive Language:</strong> Events are labeled with emotionally charged text like "Significant clinic closures" to strengthen the connection between policy and abortion rates. <em>(Deception Score: -1)</em></li>
        <li> <strong>Selective Event Filtering:</strong> Only states with notable abortion rate declines are highlighted, omitting states with different outcomes. <em>(Deception Score: -1)</em></li>
        <li> <strong>Regression Line Emphasis:</strong> A fitted trend line exaggerates the perceived correlation. <em>(Deception Score: -1.5)</em></li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Opposing Visualization: Resilient Trends in Abortion Access</h2>
      <p>
        This visualization aims to challenge the proposition by showing that some states experienced stable or even rising abortion rates despite clinic closures. By emphasizing outliers and highlighting alternative social factors, the visualization undermines the simplicity of the "closure equals reduction" argument.
      </p>

      <figure>
        <img src="../images/bar_chart.jpg" alt="Stacked Bar Chart">
        <figcaption>Comparing Clinic Closures and Abortion Rate Changes by State (2017-2020)</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <h3>Design Rationale</h3>
      <ul>
        <li> <strong>Outlier Focus:</strong> The visualization draws attention to states with rising abortion rates despite clinic closures. <em>(Deception Score: -0.5)</em></li>
        <li> <strong>Expanded Time Frame:</strong> Data from prior years is included to obscure the influence of recent clinic closures. <em>(Deception Score: -1)</em></li>
        <li> <strong>Vivid Contrasting Colors:</strong> Strong color differences between decreasing and stable rates create visual ambiguity. <em>(Deception Score: -1)</em></li>
      </ul>
    </section>

      <h2>Final Reflection</h2>
      <p>
        Creating these visualizations required balancing honesty with persuasive techniques. While both designs effectively convey their respective messages, the most powerful design choices involved selective data filtering, timeline manipulation, and emotionally charged language. This experience highlighted that persuasive visualization often succeeds through omission rather than fabrication.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ultimately, I learned that ethical visualization should embrace transparency, context, and respect for the viewer’s autonomy. Persuasion and deception are often intertwined, and this assignment underscored how powerful narrative framing can reshape data perception — whether intentionally or unintentionally.
